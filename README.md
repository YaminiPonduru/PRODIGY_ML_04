In this project, I developed a hand gesture recognition model to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from image or video data. Utilizing the [Leap Gesture Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog), I built a model to enhance intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. This task involved:
Data Preparation,Model Development,Evaluation.I used Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras to handle image data and implement the recognition model. This project improved my skills in deep learning and computer vision, providing practical experience in developing interactive applications.
